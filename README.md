Now we are going to create some sample tickets as end users (karen or Ken) 
and assign and set properties as a agent (John)
and resolve tickets as a agent ( John or Jane)


Step 1: Create Tickets as End-User (Karen or Ken)
Ticket 1: “Entire mobile/online banking system is down.”

Ticket 2: “Accounting department needs Adobe upgrade; currently broken.”

Ticket 3: “CFO’s laptop will no longer turn on.”

Best Practices & Reminders
Email Functionality: Most systems send ticket updates to users. They can respond via email.

Real-World Intake:

Tickets come via phone, chat, email, web form, or casual in-person requests.

It’s okay to help immediately, but always log a ticket for tracking and metrics.
